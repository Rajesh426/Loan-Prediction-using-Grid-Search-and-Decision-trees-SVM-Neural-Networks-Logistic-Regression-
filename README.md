# Loan-Prediction-using-Grid-Search-and-Decision-trees-SVM-Neural-Networks-Logistic-Regression-
Predicting Loan on a realtime data using Most famous Machine Learning Algorithms [ Logistic Regression, K Nearest Neighbour, Random Forest SVM and Neural networks ] 
Its a Ipython file implemented for classification problem <br>
## Here actual loan data is store in the New folder zip file but a sample is also updated in the loan.csv file which is less than 25MB <br>
### Dictionary csv file is also added which will have the all abrivations for the columns <br>
# Hyperparameters tuning <br>

Hyperparameter tuning is done with the help og grid search for all algorithms <br>

# Following Steps are performed on data <br>

# Target Label is "loan_status" <br>

## Cleaning <br>
Most of the data cleaning is performed by removing the coloumns with 3/4 of the size of the rows are NaNs<br>

## Data Processing <br>
String data type is converted into numeric values with using the map and lambda function in python  <br>

## Data Analysis <br>
Data Analysing is perfomred by Correlation between the features and the target <br>

## Modeling <br>
### Four Classical Machine algorithms are implemented <br>


### Logistic Regression <br>
### SVM <br>
### Random forest <br>
### Neural Networks <br>
### K Nearest Neighbour <br>

# Performance <br>

Model performance is done by calculating the F1 score , recall , precision <br>
